# texts

This is a repository for encoded texts relating to my dissertation.

clean_and_write is a module designed to clean up text from the Latin Library (lowercase all text; remove punctuation, spaces, and line numbers), saved as text files in raw_texts, and write the cleaned up text to a new file in clean_texts.

test specifies tuple pairs for the raw and cleaned up text files and runs the select_file function from clean_and_write.
