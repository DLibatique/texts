# texts

This is a repository for various coding projects relating to Classics.

clean_and_write is a module designed to clean up text from the Latin Library (lowercase all text; remove punctuation, spaces, and line numbers), saved as text files in raw_texts, and write the cleaned up text to a new file in clean_texts.

test specifies tuple pairs for the raw and cleaned up text files and runs the select_file function from clean_and_write.

old_scripts comprises scripts that are now part of other scripts.

other_projects involves XML projects that I'm not touching in depth quite yet.
